          <p>My name is Shantao Yi, and I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science 
            degree in Computer Science at 
            <a href = "https://ucsd.edu/" class="text-highlight"><strong>UC San Diego</strong></a>.  
            I am passionate about creative thinking, team coordination, and organization leadership.</p><br>
          <p>Throughout my intensive undergraduate study, I devoted myself to the practical and professional 
            aspects of the Software Engineering industry through 
            <a href = "https://ucsd.edu/" class="text-highlight"><strong>multiple internships</strong></a> 
            as well as 
            <a href = "https://ucsd.edu/" class="text-highlight"><strong>hands-on projects</strong></a> 
            My internship experience also kindled my interest in the field of Product Management, as I further
            honed my related skills by 
            <a href = "https://ucsd.edu/" class="text-highlight"><strong>managing several products</strong></a>
            that created significantly positive impact.</p><br>
          <p>Besides my professional endeavors, I have been actively giving back to my school’s Computer Science 
            community through my two-year commitment as an 
            <a href = "https://cse.ucsd.edu/undergraduate/readers-and-tutors" class="text-highlight"><strong>academic tutor</strong></a>
            . I founded and am currently the Department Lead of
